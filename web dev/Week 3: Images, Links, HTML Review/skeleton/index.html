<!-- In order to create a website you need a couple important things:
	1. html tag that lets the computer know this is an html file(look at line 2)
	2. head tag to import css(something we use later on to add colors and other cool things!)
	3. body tag: this is where you will write all the html for your website!
-->
	<!-- This lab will focus on things you like so think of a general topic that you enjoy(sports, games, cooking, etc...) -->
	<body>
	<!-- Below this line, use an h tag to give ur website a title! -->
	
	<!-- Below this line, use a p tag to say "Some things I like are:" -->
	
	<!-- Below this line, create an unordered list using the <ul> tag to list some specific things about your topic of interest.
	So if you like sports, what sports do you like?
	TODO: List at least 3 different things
	-->
	
	<!-- Below this line, create an ordered list to rank those some things from above from best to worst(1 to 3)-->
	
	<!-- Add an image of your #1 choice!
	HINT: GO on google, download an image, and drag it into the files folder in the left! 
	-->
	
	<!-- Add 2 spaces between the image and the next line(what tag does this?), then use create a link to a website that talks about the thing you like and makes sure its bolded! -->
